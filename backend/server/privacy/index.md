Last revised July 13, 2024

This privacy policy for TrackMyRep (also referred to as TMR), describes how and why TMR might collect, store, use, and/or share (“process“) your information when you download and use the TMR browser extension.

Reading this privacy policy will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use TMR. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact TMR.

### Data collection

When you click the TMR icon in your browser, TMR automatically collects the title of the web page that you are currently viewing. This is so that TMR can determine what legislation is relevant to the page that you are viewing. For processing, this data is sent to TMR’s servers and to OpenAI. When this data is sent to OpenAI, it is subject to [OpenAI’s privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/).

TMR may request access or permission to location-based information from your device. TMR uses GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells TMR your current location This is used to determine your congressional district and the identity of your representative in Congress. Location-based information is never sent to TMR’s servers or anywhere outside of your device. You can opt out of allowing TMR to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, TMR may not function.

TMR does not process sensitive information.

TMR automatically collects certain information when you use or navigate TMR. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use TMR, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of TMR, and for TMR's internal analytics and reporting purposes.

### Data processing

Personal information is processed by TMR only for providing the functionality of TMR and to fulfill legal obligations.

### Selling and sharing of data

TMR does not sell or share personal information with any third party.

### Third-party services

TMR may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications that are not affiliated with TMR and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, TMR does not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and TMR will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by TMR. TMR cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. TMR are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from TMR. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

### Duration of information storage

TMR will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require TMR keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time during which you use TMR.

When TMR has no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, TMR will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then TMR will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### Information safety

TMR has implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information TMR processes. However, despite TMR's safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so TMR cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat TMR’s security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although TMR will do its best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from TMR is at your own risk. You should only access TMR within a secure environment.

### Minimum age

TMR does not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using TMR, you represent that you are at least 18. If TMR learns that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, TMR will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from TMR’s records. If you become aware of any data TMR may have collected from children under age 18, please contact TMR.

### Location

TMR does not knowingly solicit data from or market to anyone outside the United States. TMR may not function outside of the U.S. By using TMR, you represent that you are a U.S. resident. If TMR learns that personal information from non-U.S. residents, TMR will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from TMR’s records. If you become aware of any data TMR may have collected from non-U.S. residents, please contact TMR.

### Do-Not-Track setting

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, TMR does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that TMR must follow in the future, TMR will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

### Updates

TMR may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If TMR makes material changes to this privacy notice, TMR may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. TMR encourages you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how TMR is protecting your information.
