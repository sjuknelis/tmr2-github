    <h3 id="data-collection">Data collection</h3>
    <p>When you click the TMR icon in your browser, TMR automatically collects the title of the web page that you are currently viewing. This is so that TMR can determine what legislation is relevant to the page that you are viewing. For processing, this data is sent to TMR’s servers and to OpenAI. When this data is sent to OpenAI, it is subject to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/">OpenAI’s privacy policy</a>.</p>
    <p>TMR may request access or permission to location-based information from your device. TMR uses GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location This is used to determine your congressional district and the identity of your representative in Congress. Location-based information is never sent to TMR’s servers or anywhere outside of your device. You can opt out of allowing TMR to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, TMR may not function.</p>

    <p>TMR automatically collects certain information when you use or navigate TMR.

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of TMR, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
    <h3 id="data-processing">Data processing</h3>
    <p>Personal information is processed by TMR only for providing the functionality of TMR and to fulfill legal obligations.</p>

    <h3 id="third-party-services">Third-party services</h3>
    <p>TMR may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, TMR does not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and TMR will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications.

    <p>TMR will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require TMR keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time during which you use TMR.</p>
    <p>When TMR has no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, TMR will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then TMR will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    <h3 id="information-safety">Information safety</h3>
    <p>TMR has implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information TMR processes. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so TMR cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat TMR’s security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although TMR will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from TMR is at your own risk. You should only access TMR within a secure environment.</p>

At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, TMR does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that TMR must follow in the future, TMR will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
